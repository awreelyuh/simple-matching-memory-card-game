# Aurelia's Matching Memory Card Game

## Description
A simple memory game where the user finds matching pairs of identical cards. This was developed as the capstone project for the Code Kentucky Web Development 1 course and was inspired by my oldest son, Alben.

Alben has tested this card game extensively and given it a 10 out of 10.

## Project Features
